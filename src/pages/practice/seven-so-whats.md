  The Seven **So-Whats** is a powerful critical thinking framework designed to
  explore the potential consequences and implications of an idea. By
  consistently asking "So what?" we move beyond a superficial understanding of a
  solution's impact to uncover potential ripple effects, whether positive or
  negative.\

  \

  The origin of the general **"So What?"** question is often traced to educational and strategic reflection models, such as Terry Borton's "What, So What, Now What" framework from the 1970s.

  Using the **& So-What's**This helps teams:


  * **Create actionable insights:** It transforms static information into a clear call to action, ensuring that every discovery has a purpose.

  * **Explore consequences:** It forces you to think systematically about the downstream effects of an idea, preventing you from being blindsided by unintended outcomes.

  * **Build a culture of ownership:** It encourages team members to take responsibility for turning insights into results, fostering a proactive and accountable environment.

  * **Improve decision-making:** By connecting findings to their implications, teams can make more informed and strategic decisions.
howTo: >-
  

  1. **State your idea or recommendation.**

  2. **Ask the first "So what?":** What is the immediate consequence of this action? Write down the answer.

  3. **Repeat the process six more times:** Take the previous consequence and ask, "So what?" again. This forces you to think about the downstream effects of each answer, peeling back the layers of a decision's impact.


  By the end of the process, you'll have a much more comprehensive understanding of your initial idea's consequences, leading to more robust and well-considered decisions.
